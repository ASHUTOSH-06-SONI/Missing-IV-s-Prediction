In this Repository, I have added the codes for finding out the missing values in the NIFTY50's Implied Volatilities where the data is of almost per second frequency
Since, the dataset size exceeded, I couldn't add them in here but these codes can be used accordingly
I've tested various mechanisms here like LightGBM, XGBoost etc..
I've also tried to fit in Physics Informed Neural Network 
The papers for the same are also attached in the repository.
Further work is in progress...
Thank you for reading
